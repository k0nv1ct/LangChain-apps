# LangChain Tutorial

This is a tutorial for using LangChain, a language modeling framework, to generate Python code and obtain detailed information on a given topic.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- OpenAI API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

1. Obtain an OpenAI API key.
2. Create a file named `apikey.py` in the root directory of the project.
3. In `apikey.py`, define a variable named `apikey` and assign your API key to it.

## Usage

1. Run the following command to start the Streamlit application:

```shell
streamlit run main.py
```

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to access the LangChain tutorial.

3. In the text input field, enter your query or topic.

4. The application will generate Python code related to the topic and provide detailed explanations.

5. View the generated code and information on the screen.
